# Gym Discord bot

Usually I input my workout sessions in Excel's mobile app, but their UI is extremely clunky which is why I made this Discord bot to register my workouts for me.
For now, this is just an MVP with lots of bugs, hardcoded items, and no error handling. Those will be fixed in the future, this is just meant for personal use so the bot will not be very robust (it's a private bot as well).

Usage:
You just type in "Exercise name [sets]x[reps] [weight]kg" and the bot will track it

Features I want to implement later:
- Personal record ("PR") tracking
- Trained volume (in kg) trained per exercise, per week/month, per muscle group
- TBD
